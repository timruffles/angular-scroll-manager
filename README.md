# Simple Angular Skeleton

Angular is really easy to get into if you keep it simple. Ignore all the moving parts like bower, yeoman suggested by the docs. Learn angular first.

Even for projects I often prefer this approach. Why add to the maintaince burdeon for something that is low-traffic, or has a team with mixed skill levels?

Clone this. Open `index.html`. You should see a working angular app [like this](http://timruffles.github.io/simple-angular-skeleton/). Yay!

Front end development should be fun.
